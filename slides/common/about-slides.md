## Pre-Requisites 1

- Basic Docker knowledge

- If on Windows, it's probably a good idea to install `git-bash`!

- You will need the `kubeconfig` file

  - Copy to `~/.kube/config`

  - If you have a config file already, you can put this somewhere else and reference via an `ENV` variable.

  - E.g., `export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/config/file`

- You will need `kubectl`

  - If on MacOSX you can install via `brew`
